This is an implentation of MIPS piplined processors, the implemented processors supports add,sub,sll,and,or,sw,lw instructions,taking data and control hazards into consideration.


Test cases are implemented such that it loads data from data memory into registers then it operates on them.


**Main Modules directory:

Each main module is written in a separate file.


**Test Cases directory:

1-without hazards

2-Data hazards

3-Data and Control hazards

4-Data and Control hazards 2

5-Random 1

6-Random 2
